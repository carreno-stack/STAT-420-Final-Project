## Introduction


## Methods
```{r}
#Loading startups data
library(dplyr)
startups = read.csv("startups.csv")

#Bringing in acquisitions data so that we can use the field acquired_at
acquisitions = read.csv("acquisitions.csv")
colnames(acquisitions)[4] = "company_id"
startups = merge(startups,acquisitions, by = "company_id")

#Generating the startups data to be used
startups = startups %>% select(
  #Selecting pre-defined fields
  category_code,
  normalized_name,
  logo_width,
  logo_height,
  country_code,
  city,
  investment_rounds,
  invested_companies,
  milestones,
  relationships,
  funding_total_usd,
  acquired_at
) %>% mutate(
  #Adding extra columns: logo ratio, name length, and acquired at
  logo_ratio = logo_width / logo_height,
  name_length = nchar(as.character(startups$normalized_name)),
  acquired_at = as.Date(as.character(acquired_at))
)

#Splitting between train and test data (80/20)
set.seed(20200804)

#Index for 80% of the data
train_index = sample(1:nrow(startups), size = floor(0.8 * nrow(startups)))

startups_tr = startups[train_index,]
startups_te = startups[-train_index,]
write_csv(x = startups_tr, path = "./startups_tr.csv")
write_csv(x = startups_te, path = "./startups_te.csv")

```
